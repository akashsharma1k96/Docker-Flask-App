DOCKER-FLASK-APP
A simple Flask web application containerized with Docker.

This project demonstrates the basics of Docker, containerization, and running a Python web app inside a container. It's perfect for learning Docker and showcasing DevOps skills on your resume.

🖥️ Project Features
Python Flask backend web application

Dockerized for a consistent environment across different systems

Runs inside a container using Docker

Easily extendable to include databases, Nginx, or monitoring tools

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker Desktop installed

Basic understanding of the command-line interface (PowerShell, Terminal)

Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DOCKER-FLASK-APP.git
cd DOCKER-FLASK-APP
Build the Docker Image
This command reads the Dockerfile and creates a Docker image tagged as docker-flask-app.

Bash

docker build -t docker-flask-app .
Run the Docker Container
This command starts a container and maps port 5000 from your machine to port 5000 inside the container.
